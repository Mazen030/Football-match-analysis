# Project Description: AI-Based Football Match Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced system for detecting and tracking players, referees, and footballs in video footage of football matches using YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detection model. We will enhance the model's performance through custom training. <br>
## Key Objectives
## 1-Player and Object Detection:

Utilize YOLO for real-time detection of players, referees, and footballs in match videos.<br>
Improve detection accuracy by training the model on a customized dataset.<br>
## 2-Team Assignment:

Implement K-means clustering for pixel segmentation to classify players into teams based on the colors of their t-shirts. <br>
## 3-Ball Acquisition Analysis:

Measure each team's ball acquisition percentage during the match using the detected objects and team assignments.
## 4-Camera Movement Tracking:

Apply optical flow techniques to detect and measure camera movement between frames, ensuring accurate player tracking. <br>
## 5-Perspective Transformation:

Use perspective transformation to account for depth and perspective, allowing for accurate measurements of player movements in meters instead of pixels. <br>
## 6-Player Movement and Speed Calculation:

Calculate the distance covered and speed of players based on their movements throughout the match.
